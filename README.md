## View the Dashboard App 


(The app was too large to deploy on shinyapps.io) 


## Background

This shiny dashboard app provides an analysis of film trends overtime based on variables such as ratings, budget, gross, and more. The data spans from 1980-2020 and includes information about movies released in more than 100 countries around the world and contains 7668 total observations and 15 total variables. 

There are several components to this dashboard. 

The initial page illustrates general trends using bar graphs and line plots. You are able to observe the distributions of several variables in the bar graphs as well as the average of variables such as the score and ratings overtime with the line plot. 

The 'Trends by Company' page allows you to explore the differences between the top 3 grossing companies and the worst 3 grossing companies. 

The 'Trends by Country' page allows you to explore the distributions of data for each country. You are given an option for the country you which to learn more about as well as which variables you want to observe.
